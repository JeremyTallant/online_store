# Online Store Project
## Description
This online store project is a simple Python-based command-line application that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles. It allows users to interact with a virtual store, where they can browse products, add items to their shopping cart, remove items, view their cart, and checkout. Users can also load fake money into their account to simulate purchasing items. The project uses classes and objects to represent various components, such as products, shopping carts, and users, showcasing the practical application of object-oriented programming.
